Report Date: 03-08-2021
Weakness: Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS)

Summary -> website https://www.Vulnweb.com having a Sub-Domain->https://www.testasp.Vulnweb.com
	 has an search that is vulnerableto an injection vulnerability - namely a reflected injection of JavaScript,
	 also known as Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
	 As per OWASP'sdefinition: "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection,
	 in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. "
	 This happens because one of the GET parameters "p" does not properly sanitize/escape user input, allowing an injection to occur. 

Steps To Reproduce -> 

	Step 1: Visit http://testasp.vulnweb.com/

	Step 2: On the top menu you will find a search option.

	Step 3: Click on it and you will be prompted with the Search box.

	Step 4: You can intercept the request in Burp Suite

	Step 5: Now you can find different payloads for XSS. 
		For proof of concept you can use this vulnerability code payload:= </scrip</script>t><img src =q onerror=prompt(8)>
		And Screenshot for PoC will be given in the Documents attached to the file.

	Step 6: Send the request to the intruder and paste all the payloads.

	Step 7: Try to find a successful payload for XSS.


Impact ->
	With user interaction, an attacker could execute arbitrary Javascript code in a victim's browser.
		1)This would allow an attacker to unwillingly make a victim:
		2)Perform any action in the identified endpoint
		3)View any information that the user is able to view
		4)Modify any information that the user is able to modify (not sure if applicable in this case)
		5)Interact with other application users as if it were him - impersonation (not sure if applicable in this case)

Mitigation -> If you want to prevent your website from vulnebralities of XSS then you can just enable noscript on browser.
