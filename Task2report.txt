2)Apache HTTP Server Resource Management Errors Vulnerability

** DISPUTED ** Unspecified vulnerability in mod_proxy_balancer for Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.7-dev, when running on Windows, allows remote attackers to trigger memory corruption via a long URL. NOTE: the vendor could not reproduce this issue.

4)Apache HTTP Server Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') Vulnerability

CRLF injection vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks by uploading a file with a multi-line name containing HTTP header sequences and a file extension, which leads to injection within a (1) "406 Not Acceptable" or (2) "300 Multiple Choices" HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request for the file.

5)Apache HTTP Server Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Vulnerability

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.0 through 2.2.6, 2.0.35 through 2.0.61, and 1.3.2 through 1.3.39, when the server-status page is enabled, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.

6)Apache HTTP Server Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Vulnerability

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the (1) mod_imap module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.0 through 1.3.39 and 2.0.35 through 2.0.61 and the (2) mod_imagemap module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.0 through 2.2.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.

•CVE-2007-5000

7)Apache HTTP Server Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor Vulnerability

Apache HTTP Server, when running on Linux with a document root on a Windows share mounted using smbfs, allows remote attackers to obtain unprocessed content such as source files for .php programs via a trailing "\" (backslash), which is not handled by the intended AddType directive.

External References
•CVE-2007-6514

8)Apache HTTP Server Resource Management Errors Vulnerability

The balancer_handler function in mod_proxy_balancer in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.0 through 2.2.6, when a threaded Multi-Processing Module is used, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (child process crash) via an invalid bb variable.

•CVE-2007-6422

9)Apache HTTP Server Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') Vulnerability

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by uploading a file with a name containing XSS sequences and a file extension, which leads to injection within a (1) "406 Not Acceptable" or (2) "300 Multiple Choices" HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request for the file.

•CVE-2008-0455

10)Apache HTTP Server Cryptographic Issues Vulnerability

The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products, does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a "plaintext injection" attack, aka the "Project Mogul" issue.

•CVE-2009-3555

11)Apache HTTP Server Other Vulnerability

The Solaris pollset feature in the Event Port backend in poll/unix/port.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.3.9, as used in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.14 and other products, does not properly handle errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via unspecified HTTP requests, related to the prefork and event MPMs.

External References
•CVE-2009-2699

13)Apache HTTP Server Other Vulnerability

The mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and send arbitrary commands to an FTP server via vectors related to the embedding of these commands in the Authorization HTTP header, as demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.11.

•CVE-2009-3095

14)Apache HTTP Server Other Vulnerability

The Solaris pollset feature in the Event Port backend in poll/unix/port.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.3.9, as used in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.14 and other products, does not properly handle errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via unspecified HTTP requests, related to the prefork and event MPMs.

•CVE-2009-2699

15)Apache HTTP Server Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor Vulnerability

The ap_read_request function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15, when a multithreaded MPM is used, does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances involving a parent request that has a body, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
